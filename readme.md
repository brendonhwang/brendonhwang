Hello, my name is Brendon Hwang.

As a kid, I was always immersed in the world of Legos, fascinated by the ability to construct diverse creations from raw pieces. Similarly, my work with data mirrors that process â€” starting with raw data, cleaning and organizing it, and connecting the pieces to craft meaningful insights. Projects in this realm often lead to innovative solutions and improved decision-making, fueling my passion for data analysis. 

I invite you to explore my projects on the National Response Center and Video Game Sales and Rating. These examples showcase my hands-on experience and practical application of my skills.

Key Qualifications: 
* Proficiency in SQL, Advanced Excel, Python, and Tableau
